# ckeditor-plugin-pagebreak
Adds a "page break" feature to the CKeditor text editor.

Based on the original [pagebreak plugin for ckeditor](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/tree/master/plugins/pagebreak), this one uses a CSS class instead of inline style, so that it will be more controllable and its HTML is less likely to be stripped from the formatted text. This feature can then be used to split longer text blocks across multiple screens.

See [ckeditor-dev/LICENSE.md](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for the original license.
